Name: Eli Dow
I spent 10 hours on this problem (4 on problem 1, 5 on problem 2, and 1 on problem 3)
I sought help from my classmates Emil Polakiewicz and Ananya Pavuluri.
With Ananya, we talked about the code demo posted on canvas to understand it better. With Emil, we talked about how
to find the training and testing errors in problem 2.
