The reason that we wouldn't just use it for this task is that we care more about the true positives. In our case, the performance should be based on how well we can determine that patients have cancer. Thus, the classifier's performance is not based on predicting true negatives, it is based on predicting true positives. This classifier could not predict any occurrences of cancer based on any combination of features, so therefore, it wouldn't be that useful."

The worst error is that it is possible for the model to predict a false negative, which means that a patient with cancer would not be properly diagnosed. The cost of this mistake would lead to the patient's cancer growing and probably death. As a result, this model has a cost of death along with the patient's physical/emotional trauma that comes with it. Otherwise, the always-0 classifier does make a correct prediction since patients who do not have cancer are correctly predicted. However, a model that predicts the same result in every scenario is a bad model. As a result of these possible costs, I would recommend not using this model because it makes the mistake of not predicting people who have cancer properly."

    "**Answer**: The Perceptron model has a much lower accuracy on the training and testing data than the always-0 classifier. However, the always-0 classifier results in a lot of false negatives (25), which is really bad because it could lead to the death of those patients. The Perceptron Model has 0 false negatives, and instead 91 false positives, which is not completely accurate, but it is better to think you have cancer when you don't thatn to think you don't have cancer when you do. Therefore, the cost of the always 0 classifier is much worse than the Perceptron, even if the Perceptron is less accurate.\n"

    "**Answer**: The plot is showing me that for the most part, the training and testing accuracy are around 0.85 and 0.86 respectively. However, there are few alpha values that cause the accuracy for both to dip. Around alpha value 10^-3, the testing accuracy decreases below 0.6 and the training accuracy decreases below 0.5. Around 10^-2, both accuracies fall all the way to 0.15. Compared to prior assignments, this plot starts off with small fluctuations, followed by big fluctuations, but then stays relatively flat."

    "**Answer**: The ROC Curves in the plot and the AUC values tell us a lot. \n",
    "\n",
    "ROC curves are a way to look at classifier performance and look at the ratio of true positive rates and false positive rates. The Perceptron model ROC curve shows that for low false positive rates, the true positive rate is fairly high (other than close to 0). As false positive rates get higher, the true positive rate approaches 1, and it finally does this at a false positive rate at 0.5. Similarly, the Probabilistic Model ROC curve shows that for low false positive rates, the true positive rate is fairly high, maybe a little lower than the Perceptron Model. However, the Probabilistic Model reaches a true positive rate of 1.0 at lower false positive rate (0.4) than the Perceptron Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, ROC can ve nuanced and the curve does not tell us how the algorithm performed. The areas under the curves (AUC) is a good metric for performance. A larger area means the curve gets higher true positive success rate earlier. Thus, we see that the AUC for testing of the perceptron is very high (0.884) as well as the AUC for testing of the Probabilistic Model (0.886). Thus, this means that the Probabilistic Model gets a higher true positive success rate earlier than the Perceptron Model, but it's relatively close."
