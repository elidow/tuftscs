Name: Eli Dow
I spent 12 hours on this problem:
    1 hour on #1
    1 hour on #2
    2 hours on #3
    4 hours on #4
    4 hours on #5
I used the all the sklearn web pages provided in the spec as resources.
I sought help from my classmates Emil Polakiewicz and Ananya Pavuluri.
With Ananya, we discussed 4b. With Emil, we talked about how to combine 
the training and testing data in 4, and also the results of predict_proba
