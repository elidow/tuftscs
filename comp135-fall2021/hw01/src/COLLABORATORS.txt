Name: Eli Dow
I spent about 2.5 hours on this problem (1 hour to get use to numpy, and 1.5 hour to do the assignment)
The only help I got from professors, TAs, or students was from Emil Polakiewicz (student) when we discussed the
different cases for random_state
The only online sources I consulted were the online tutorials for numpy that were provided in the spec.
