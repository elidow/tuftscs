    <p>
        API Details:<br>
        The API that I selected is called TV MAZE. TV MAZE is an API in which
        you can access any TV information and add it to your website or app. It
        provides a free, clean REST API that returns JSON so that you can access
        information such as show names, genres, summaries, and much more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Website Citation:<br>
        I discovered this API by browsing a webpage on RapidAPI that listed 29
        free APIs that returned information in JSON. I also looked it up the 
        API itself on google to find more commands.

    </p>
    <p>
        Options:<br>
        I was given several options for the tv show. It gave basic information 
        such as the title of the show, the genres, and the language. But it also 
        gave information such as its network, its summary, its average rating on  
        websites, and its airing time. I chose to output the name, the rating,  
        the summary, and the network of one of my favorite shows, Game of Thrones 
        (last season doesn't count).
    </p>
    <p>
        Two Applications<br>
        This API would be very useful in a streaming service like Netflix. 
        The application could access details about a show so the user can 
        determine if they want to watch it. Another API that would be super 
        useful is one that lists times of shows such as TV Guide Mobile. They 
        could use the same information as streaming services, and use details 
        on top of that such as the status of the show (has it ended yet), what 
        network it is on, and how long the air time is. TV MAZE is very useful!
