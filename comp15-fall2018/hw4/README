Purpose: The purpose of hw4 is to implement a binary search tree. A binary
		 search tree has the invariant that all nodes to the left of a node are
		 smaller in value, and all nodes to the right are larger in value.
		 We are also implementing a copy constuctor and an assignment overload
		 for the binary search tree as well.

Files:

Name: main.cpp
Description: This file is the main driver that tests different functions and
			 creates copies. Tests parts of the program one at a
			 time(unit-testing).

Name: BinarySearchTree.h
Description: BinarySearchTree.h contains declarations and descriptions of all
			 the Binary search tree functions and attributes, including any 
			 helper functions.

Name: BinarySearchTree.cpp
Description: BinarySearchTree.cpp contains all of the functions of
			 BinarySearchTree that were implemented. The BST is constructed by
			 a node, that has data, with a left and right pointer. Also, I 
			 created a copy constuctor and an assignement overload to make deep
			 copies of BST.

Name: pretty_print.cpp
Description: pretty_print.cpp is called from a function in BinarySearchTree.cpp
			 and it prints the current BST is a "pretty" format.



How to compile and run your program:

Compiled: clang++ -g -Wall -Wextra main.cpp BinarySearchTree.cpp pretty_print.cpp
 -o main

Run: ./main


Data Structures and Algorithms:

	I used a LinkedList with two pointers for this assignment. LinkedLists are
typical for binary search trees and trees in general because they split info
into nodes that are accessed by pointers. LL made it easy to compare the data
of the node, insert, and remove compared to an ArrayList.


Details and Explanation of Testing:

	I tested my code by using the testing.cpp driver. In that file,
I would output every function of BinarySearchTree.cpp individually
(sometimes in groups) to make sure it was working, similar to how it did so in
main.cpp. In a lot of functions of BinarySearchTree, I had to check that my 
implements for the BST were correct.
