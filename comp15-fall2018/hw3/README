Purpose: The purpose is to simulate checkout lines in a grocery store, and this 
		 is implemented with a CheckoutQueue class. We are taking in shoppers
		 waiting to check out and outputting data on how long it took.

Files:

Name: CheckoutQueue.h
Description: CheckoutQueue.h contains declarations of all the CheckoutQueue
			 functions and attibutes.

Name: CheckoutQueue.cpp
Description: CheckoutQueue.cpp contains all of the functions of CheckoutQueue,
			 including the implemented funtions. It uses a LinkedList.

Name: GrocerySim.h
Description: GrocerySim.h contains declarations of all the GrocerySim functions
			 and attibutes.

Name: GrocerySim.cpp
Description: GrocerySim.cpp contains all of the functions of GrocerySim,
			 including the implemented funtions. It has a run function in which
			 it simulates the entire grocery store until there are no shoppers.

Name: testCheckoutQueue.cpp
Description: This file is an alternative driver containing different testing
			 functions used to make sure that the code works errors. Tests one
			 part of the program at a time(unit-testing)


How to compile and run your program:

Compiled: make driver
Run: ./driver NUM_STANDARD_LANES NUM_EXPRESS_LANES MAX_EXPRESS_ITEMS
	 [INPUT_FILE]


Data Structures and Algorithms

	I used a LinkedList for this assignment. Using a LinkedList not only made it
easy to insert shoppers at the back, but I did not have to worry about
expanding or contracting. In the enqueue function, it was easy to insert
in the back of the queue because one of the LinkedList's attributes was a 
back pointer. Also, in the dequeue function, it was easy to check for
run-time errors(head is null) and, otherwise, set the head to the next.


Details and Explanation of Testing:
	I tested my code by using the testaCheckoutQueue driver. In that file,
I would output every function individually(sometimes in groups) to make sure it
was working. In a lot of functions of CheckoutQueue, I had to make sure I was
using LinkedList correctly. I also outputted in various parts of the run
function of GrocerySim to find errors in helper/CheckoutQueue functions.
