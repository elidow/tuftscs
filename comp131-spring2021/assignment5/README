Classes/Functions:

Bird:

default constructor

getObject(): returns a string identifying it as a bird

Aircraft:

default constructor

getObject(): returns a string identifying it as an aircraft

Bayesian Class:

default constructor with probabilities

generate_likelihood(obj): generates likelihood for each object based on speed

read_speeddata(data): reads data

calcNewProbability(currP, data): calculates new probability based on curr
                                 probability and data

helper functions:
 - probability based on likelihood speed
 - classification probability
 - transition between classes of objects
 - fluctuation (EXTRA CREDIT)

report_probability(prob): based on probability, reports which 


Design Plan:

Make Intro Menu: 
- Would u like to calc/report with Bayesian Classifier?
- How to pass in info and start Bayesian Classifier
   data.txt:
    - each object from each track is on a line (10 lines total)
    - each number is a 0-200 (13 digits after decimal)
    - each number seperated by commas, no space
    - NaN means not able to pick up 

   pdf.text:
    - each line represents the set of y coordinates of line 
    - first line is birds, second line is aircrafts
    - each number starts at x = 0, then goes to x = 200 (up by 0.5)

Write classes:
- Bird and Aircraft: all
- Bayesian: Constructor and function definitions/contracts

Read Data in and seperate numbers and datapoints
- Review file stuff (open)
- Practice reading/storing and try to seperate single speeds (with comma)
- Practice reading/storing and try to seperate diff objects (diff line)
