How to Run/Test Problem:

To run this program, just run main.py. For the first menu, enter 1 if you wish 
to run the algorithm. For the second menu, here are the following options: 
- enter 1 if you wish to solve the easy puzzle provided (less than 0.03 sec)
- enter 2 if you wish to solve the evil puzzle provided 
  (usually takes under 7 seconds)
- enter 3 if you wish to enter your own puzzle (time depends)

What it outputs:

It should output the solution board and the time it takes to solve. This 
program assumes that the initial board given has a possible sudoku solution.

Answer to question:

Conflict-directed Backjumping can be used. This program provides a version of 
back-jumping with the use of a queue. Everytime we have to chose between more 
than one option for a square, we add that to the queue. That way, if we added 
the wrong number and run into a conflict down the line, we can go back to the 
original point where we ran into the conflict, and try again.
